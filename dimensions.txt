Player singular frame 31 x 45
     - total spritesheet should be a 3 frame x 4 frame sheet
     [standing, left foot forward, right foot forward]
     [facing left, left foot forward, right food forward]
     [facing right, left foot forward, right foot forward]
     [facing up (back facing the audience), left foot forward, right foot forward]

With the player this size, make other furniture sizes according to scale;

Start Screen canvas is 600 x 450 pixels, background animations are allowed

Game canvas is 600 pixels wide but 1000 pixels long. The player will go
up and down and the screen will follow the player.
     - for background, we need floor tiling on the ground
     - walls
     - each of these repeatable if possible

The setting of the game is in a laboratory. My guess is mainly a white
sort of theme. Clean and tidy. Colorful chemicals. Lab coats. etc. etc.

There are other things like "furniture" which is scientific instruments, chairs,
tables, microscopes, chemicals, coat hanger, etc. etc.
Each of these furnitures will have an interactable aspect to them. When the player
presses 'e', a zoomed-in image of the furniture will appear on screen, allowing the
player to inspect a little closer. this is for looking for clues, clicking on items,
finding patterns, etc. The specifics of what each furniture will do is tbd so I wouldn't
start on that yet.

For now, the game needs...
     - player spritesheet
     - game background
          - repeated floor tiling
          - walls (with decorations too)
